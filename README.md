# Webassets

This repository holds the assets needed to run the web interfaces of our open-source products, such as [Teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) or [Gravity](https://github.com/gravitational/gravity).

The source for those assets is available in the [webapps repository](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps). Issues or requests should be filed in that repository too - this one only exists for distribution purposes and has little manual activity.
